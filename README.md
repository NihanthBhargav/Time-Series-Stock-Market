# 📊 Time Series Analysis and Forecasting For Stock Market

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting **Apple (AAPL) stock prices** using both classical statistical models (**ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet**) and a deep learning model (**LSTM**).  
The work was carried out as part of a structured 12-week forecasting project, including **preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization**.

The main goal is to **compare different forecasting approaches**, evaluate their performance using **MAE, RMSE, MAPE**, and explore future stock price predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Yahoo Finance / Kaggle AAPL Dataset]  
- **Range:** 2015 – 2024 (approx. 2500+ business days)  
- **Feature Used:** Date, Close Price  

**Preprocessing steps:**
- Missing value handling  
- Date indexing & sorting  
- Scaling (for LSTM only)  
- Train-test split with rolling origin  

---

## ⚡ Models Implemented
- **ARIMA** – AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average  
- **SARIMA** – Seasonal ARIMA with seasonal differencing  
- **Prophet** – Additive model with trend, seasonality & changepoints  
- **LSTM** – Deep learning Recurrent Neural Network for nonlinear dependencies  

---

## 📈 Results & Evaluation
- **Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, MAPE  
- **Residual diagnostics performed:** stationarity tests, white-noise checks  

**Key Findings:**
- **LSTM** performed best on **short-term forecasts**  
- **Prophet** provided **smoother long-term forecasts**  
- **ARIMA/SARIMA** captured short-term dynamics but struggled with rapid volatility
